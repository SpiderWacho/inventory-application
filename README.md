# Inventory Application
The objective of this project was to put in practice all the things that i learned about Node.js and Express applications.
I also used MongoDB and the MVC model.

## Main take-aways and learnings
This was my firts deep dive into the express framework. I learned a lot about the back end, in the Server part i used MongoDB,a non-relational document database. I also used the MVC (model, view, controller) model to build this app.
My impression was that when you have the skeleton of the app/page that you are trying to do, a lot is repetitive, for example the controller to edit, update and delete all the objects of the database are more or less equal, with minnor changes.

I like that instead of other projects that i made of only front end, the user can make permanent changes because the database, its cool to show it to friends or familiars and that they can see lasting changes that they made.
A thing that i am proud about this project is the responsive desing, i made a navbar for the desktop view and a hamburguer menu that i really liked the result.
